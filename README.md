# LDA-for-Topic-Modelling
- Topic modelling is a technique for automatically detecting subjects in a text item and deducing hidden patterns from a corpus of text. As a result, improved decision-making is aided.
- Topic modelling is not the same as rule-based text mining techniques. It's an unsupervised method for locating and observing groups of words in big groups of texts.
